Plena provides public address solutions for places where people gather to work, worship, trade, or relax. It is a family of system elements that are combined to create public address systems tailored for virtually any applicationThe Plena product range includes:•mixers•preamplifiers•power amplifiers•a music source unit•a digital message manager•a feedback suppressor•call stations•an All-in-One system•a voice alarm system•a timer•a charger•a loop amplifierThe various elements are designed to complement each other thanks to matched acoustical, electrical and mechanical specifications.2.2 Contents of boxThe packaging box contains the following contents:•PLE-2MA120-EU, or PLE-2MA240-EU•Labels and colored pins for indicating favorite settings•Power cord•Plena Bonus CD•Mounting brackets (LBC 1901/00)2.3 The Plena Mixer AmplifierThe Plena Mixer Amplifier is a high performance,professional public address unit for mixing up to six separate microphone/line signals, and any one of three separate music signals. For a schematic overview of the Plena Mixer Amplifier, see figure 2.1 on the next page.The volume of each microphone/line signal can be individually adjusted to obtain the required mix; the mixed output is controlled via the master volume control and separate high/low tone controls.The unit is easy to use, and provides a crisp call or clear music. The amplifier also has enhanced features such as ducking level control, priority, labelling, and setting indicators.All Microphone/line inputs can be switched between microphone level and line level sensitivity. The inputs are balanced but can also be used unbalanced. Phantom power can be selected via a DIP switch to provide power to condenser microphones. Input channels 1 and 2 can take priority over all other microphone and music inputs:•Input 1 can be activated by contact closure on a PTT (push to talk). A chime can be configured to precede an announcement.•Input 2 can be switched automatically if a signal is available at the input, for example. if someone speaks into the microphone (VOX activation).A telephone/100 V emergency input with VOX activation is also provided for easy integration with another PA system or a telephone paging system. It has its own volume control and overrides all other inputs, including the call station and inputs 1 and 2.The unit also has a line output to add amplifiers for larger systems that require more output power. This output can be switched to music only, for example, so that music on hold can be provided for the telephone system. Loop through input and output connections enable external sound processing equipment (for example, an equalizer or Plena feedback suppressor) to be connected between the preamplifier and the power amplifier stages. A feedback suppressor can ensure feedback-free, clear speech for all microphones.Users can create custom labels for inputs, music sources, and output zones. These labels can be attached to the special holders at the front of the mixer amplifier. Colored pins can also be inserted at various positions around the volume and tone dial controls to indicate favorite settings for a particular application.Bosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Description en | 8An LED meter monitors the master output before the zone selection. This signal is also present on the headphone connector below the output meter. Fortotal reliability and ease of use, a limiter is integrated into the output stage to restrict output if the userapplies too much signal.The unit has 24 VDC backup input with built in 24 VDC battery charger. A separate battery charger is, therefore, not required. The charger charges the battery with a 0.5 A constant current until the battery voltage reaches 27.4 VDC. The charger then switches over to constant voltage charging (also known as float charging).NoteWhen using the unit with backup power of 24 V, make sure that the unit is always powered ON. When the unit is switched OFF, the batteries will be drained as this will be regarded as a power source. Consequently the unit will revert to 24 VDC power from the 24 V input figure 2.1: Schematic overview of the Plena Mixer AmplifierLINE/MICCALL STATIONLINE/MICLINE/MICINSInINClicksuppressiZone 2onSOut PhantomXLR+PhPower8Ohm100VCallOnly0000Bal. inputMusic only / Line outAmplifierZone 10Zone 102011D.C.supply15V,230VCUSLWall Panel input micro controllerCall Station ControlBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Description en | 92.4 Controls, connectors and indicators2.4.1Front panelSee figure 2.2 for an overview of the controls and indicators.1Power button.2Label holder for user-defined description of microphone/line inputs - custom labels can be created by user.3Master high tone control for microphone/line inputs.4Label holder for user-defined description of music sources - custom labels can be created by user.5Master high tone control for music inputs.6Label holder for user-defined description of zone names - custom labels can be created by user.7Master volume control - controls all inputs except emergency and call station.8Output level meter (-18 db, 0 db)9Input level control:•microphone/line 1•microphone/line 2•microphone/line 3•microphone/line 4•microphone/line 5•microphone/line 610Master low tone control for microphone/line inputs.11Music source selector (for music inputs 1, 2, and 3).12Music source volume control.13Master low tone control for music inputs.14Zone 1 selection button.15Zone 2 selection button16Air inlet holes.17Headphone socket. 2.4.2Plena PLE-WP2Z3S wall panelThe optional Plena PLE-WP2Z3S wall panel can be used to remotely control the unit from a maximum of four remote locations. The appearance of the wall panel is matched to the Bosch loudspeaker volume controls.The zone can be activated or deactivated, and the music source can be easily changed. The status of each zone and music source is indicated by an LED.A standard CAT 5 cable is used to connect the wall panel to the mixer-amplifier. The maximum distance is 200 m. Please refer to the relevant datasheet for more information.NoteDo not obstruct the airflow into the unit.NoteUsers can create custom labels for the: microphone/line inputs, description of the music sources, and audio output zones 1 and 2. These labels can be attached to the mixer amplifier at position numbers 2, 4, and 6 (see figure 2.2).

Do not use sharp or pointed objects.3.2 Install unit in rack (optional)The Plena Mixer Amplifier is intended for tabletop use, but you can also mount the unit in a 19" rack (see figure 3.1).If you mount the unit in a rack, you must:•ensure that it does not exceed the overheating temperature (55 °C ambient).•use the included Bosch mounting brackets (LBC 1901/00).•remove the 4 feet from the bottom of the unit.3.3 Check settings/connections1Connect any additional equipment (see section 4.1 and 4.2).2Check the settings (see section 4.3).3.4 Connect unit to mains1Make sure the voltage selector (115V/ 230V) is correctly set for the country’s main voltage (see figure 3.2). 2Make sure the power switch on the front of the unit is set to Off. 3Connect the power cord to the mains connector and plug it into the mains outlet.figure 3.1: Installing the unit in a rack1BCautionPotential equipment damage. Before connecting power, always check the voltage selector on the rear panel of the unit.figure 3.2: Power connection and voltage selectorBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Installation en | 14Intentionally left blankBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 154Connections and settings4.1 Connecting inputs4.1.1DC supply (battery)The Plena Mixer Amplifier has a 24 VDC input (terminal screw). This input can be used in mobile applications, such as boats where 120 or 230 VAC is not available or in applications that must continue to operate in case of a power failure.When a 24 VDC battery is connected (typically consisting of two 12 VDC lead-acid batteries in series), the unit will operate on the supplied DC voltage.The Plena Mixer Amplifier has as a built in charger, which charges the connected battery (or batteries if connected in series). A separate battery charger is, therefore, not required. The charger charges the battery with a 0.5 A constant current until the battery voltage reaches 27.4 VDC. The charger then switches over to constant voltage charging (also known as float charging). This means that a battery can be charged at the same rate it is discharging, and thus full capacity battery can be assured.This type of charging is suited for low duty-cycle applications where a relatively high current or power is infrequently required. CautionThe connection cable must have an in-line fuse. Use the type of fuse shown in the following figure.CautionMake sure the unit is earthed.NoteIf the backup power system has to comply to the EN54-4 standard or similar standards for backup power and charging speeds, Bosch recommends the PLN-24CH10. The PLN-24CH10 is a dedicated battery charger and power supply that is fully EN54-4 compliant.NoteIf battery charging is not required, the 0.5 A maximum output current can be used for volume overrides or other purposes instead.figure 4.1: Connecting a DC power supply12 VDC12 VDC-+-+FUSEBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 164.1.2Priority microphone (input 1)The priority microphone (or a generic call station) that can be used with push to talk (PTT) should be connected to “microphone/line 1 input”. The PTT mode can be activated by setting the DIP switch (4) at the rear of the unit. Microphone/line 1 input has priority over all other microphone/line inputs.If, however, the “Tel. emergency/100V input” receives a signal, all inputs including microphone/line 1 input will be overruled.The microphone/line 1 input has two connectors wired in parallel: •an XLR connector (for a 3 pole microphone), and•a Euro style pluggable screw terminal connector.The Euro style pluggable screw terminal connector has a trigger input, which can be used in combination with the Euro and XLR connector.The priority microphone can be connected to the microphone/line 1 input as follows:•XLR connector only. See figure 4.2.•XLR connector with trigger. See figure 4.3.•Euro connector with trigger. See figure 4.4.•Euro connector only (without trigger). Set the DIP switch settings next to the XLR connector for microphone/line 1, as required. See section 4.3.NoteIf a microphone is connected to both the XLR connector and the Euro connector for the microphone/line 1 input, the input signals will be added together.NoteWhen connecting an unbalanced line level (200 mV) signal to the microphone/line input, connect it as follows: Signal to pin 2, pin 1 and pin 3 to ground.figure 4.2: XLR connector onlyfigure 4.3: XLR connector with triggerfigure 4.4: Euro connector with triggerBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 174.1.3Secondary microphone (input 2)Connect a secondary microphone to “microphone/line input 2”. See figure 4.5.Microphone/line input 2 has a DIP switch (4) at the rear of the unit for setting the VOX mode. If the DIP switch is set to VOX, the microphone/line input will automatically be switched when a signal is sensed at the microphone/line 2 input. For example, when someone speaks into the microphone, other sound will either be muted or ducked, depending on the setting of the ducking level control at the rear of the unit. See section 4.3.The Tel. emergency/100V input, Call station input, and Microphone/line input 1 all have priority over the Microphone/line input 2. Therefore, any signal received on any one of these inputs will always be heard regardless of the ducking level control setting for Microphone/line input 2.Set the DIP switch settings next to the XLR connector as required. See section 4.3.4.1.4Additional microphones (inputs 3 through 6)Connect additional microphones to microphone/line inputs 3 through 6, as required. See figure 4.5. These microphones will mix with the background music.Set the DIP switch settings next to the XLR connector for microphone/lines 3 through 6, as required. See section 4.3.figure 4.5: Connecting microphone inputsBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 184.1.5Emergency inputsThe Tel. emergency/100V input, with VOX functionality, is used for receiving emergency announcements or signals (such as a fire alarm). This input has absolute priority, and will overrule all inputs when an emergency announcement or signal is received.Either a telephone line or a 100 V input signal can be connected to the Euro style pluggable screw terminal connector (13) at the rear of the unit. See section 4.1.5.1 and section 4.1.5.2.To adjust the volume of the emergency announcement or signal, turn the rotary dial (16) at the rear of the unit. For safety reasons, the volume of the emergency announcement or signal cannot be set to zero.The master volume control setting (7) does not influence the volume setting of the emergency announcement or signal.4.1.5.1Connecting 100 Volt input signalConnect the 100 Volt input signal as shown in figure 4.6.CautionNever connect telephone lines and a 100 V signal to the Euro style connector at the same time.NoteTel. emergency input does not mute the incoming signal so that an incoming pilot tone will be fed to the zone outputs. With this feature it is possible to use the mixer amplifier in a Bosch Voice Alarm System when using end of line boards (PLN-1EOL). The signal that is delivered to the unit should be quiet when a call is not made. The pilot tone and frequencies below 300 Hz are filtered from the trigger signal so that the input will not trigger from a pilot tone or low frequency rumble.figure 4.6: Connecting 100 Volt input signalBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 194.1.5.2Connecting telephone linesConnect the telephone lines as shown in figure 4.7.CautionA connection to a telephone network must always be made via a telephone coupler that provides adequate isolation between the telephone network (PBX) and the Plena system. The telephone coupler must also meet all relevant requirements for this type of communication equipment as imposed by law and/or responsible telecommunication organizations in the country of use. Never try to make a direct connection between the telephone network and the mixer amplifier.figure 4.7: Connecting emergency telephone linesBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 204.1.6Music source inputsWhen using a CD player, tuner or other auxiliary device for background music, connect the line-out connectors of the music source to the appropriate line-in connectors of the mixer amplifier.figure 4.8: Connecting music source inputsBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 214.2 Connecting outputs4.2.1Zone 1 and 2Connect speakers to the 100 V or 8 Ohm terminal on the Euro style pluggable screw terminal connector (25) at the rear of the unit.Also see section 4.2.5 “Connecting speakers”.4.2.2Call onlyConnect speakers to the 100 V terminal on the Euro style pluggable screw terminal connector (25) at the rear of the unit.Also see section 4.2.5 “Connecting speakers”.4.2.3Music onlyUse the music master output connector (24) to provide a dedicated music out source for another device. For example, the music master output can be connected to a telephone coupler, so that callers can listen to music when they are put on hold (see figure 4.9).To select the dedicated music out source, set the master switch for “line out or music only” (23) to “music only”. Only the music inputs (19, 20, and 21) will be audible. All other inputs, including the Tel. emergency/100V input will not be sent to this output.To hear all mixed inputs (microphone/line, emergency, and music) set the master switch for “line out or music only” (23) to “line out”.4.2.4Line out/ loop throughUse the Pre-out, amp in insert (22) external sound processing equipment (e.g. an equalizer or Plena feedback suppressor) to be connected between the preamplifier and the power amplifier stages.

The summed loudspeaker power should not exceed the rated amplifier output power. You can use the Call Only output for 3-wire remote volume control override. You can also use this output as an extra zone where announcements can be heard, but not music.4.2.5.2Low impedance loudspeakersConnect low impedance loudspeakers to the 8 Ohm/0 terminals. This output can deliver the rated output power into an 8 Ohm load. Connect multiple loudspeakers in a series/parallel-arrangement to make the combined impedance 8 Ohm or higher. Check the loudspeaker polarity for in-phase connection.figure 4.10: Connecting speakers figure 4.11: Connecting speakers Bosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 234.3 Unit settings4.3.1Rear panel settingsThe unit can be quickly set-up for operation by setting the following controls at the rear of the unit:•DIP switches•Rotary dials•Master switch for line out or music only.See the following tables for an overview of the settings and typical examples of their use.table 4.1: DIP switch settingsDIP switchOnOffTypical example (On)Chime (mic/line 1)Chime will be sounded at the beginning of an announcement.Chime will not be sounded at the beginning of an announcement.Announcement of train departure time.PTT “Push to talk” (mic/line 1 only)This input is muted when the push to talk contact is open. When the push to talk contact is closed:•this input is available for speech.•a chime will sound, if selected. •the music and other mic/line inputs will be reduced in volume to the level set by the ducking level control knob.Push to talk off. The signal will be mixed with the other mic/line signals.  Microphone 1 will mix with the background music or the other microphones in the selected zones.Users can have private conversations during live broadcasts (for example, with an all call call-station, such as the PLE-1CS).LineInput signal from line.Input signal from microphone.Depends on set-up.Speech filterEnhances clarity of speech, by cutting-off the lower frequencies of the signal.Speech filter inactive.Use for announcementsPhantom powerProvides power to condenser microphones.Phantom power unavailable.Enable phantom power if you use electret or condenser microphones.VOX (mic/line 2 only)Temporarily suppresses the background music to an adjustable “ducking level” (see table 4.2) while you speak into the microphone. The VOX mode is normally used with hand-held microphones such as the LBC 2900/15. Background music and announcements will be heard in the selected zones. A chime is not available in this mode.VOX inactive. Microphone 2 will mix with the background music or the other microphones in the selected zones.Use to make casual announcements (such as announcing the winner of a competition) while temporarily suppressing the background music to an adjustable ducking level.

When the ducking level is set to mute, the music volume will be fully attenuated; when the ducking level is set to mix, both music and speech inputs can be heard - music and speech will be mixed. When ducking the music input is ducked (attenuated), the microphone/line inputs are always muted when a call is made.Set the ducking level control to mute if you want the announcement to be heard without background music.Chime volume controlAlters the chime volume. The mid range is -8 dB (40 V), which should be sufficient for most applications. Test the chime by switching on microphone 1. Remove the microphone after testing if it is not further required.Set the volume of the chime to a higher level when the system is being used in large open areas or when important announcements have to made.Telephone emergency/100V volume controlAttenuates the emergency announcement or signal. Control range from -25 dB to 0 dB. For safety reasons, the volume of the emergency announcement or signal cannot be fully set to zero.Set the volume of the emergency announcement to a higher level when the system is being used in large open areas.NoteWhen PTT or VOX are selected, the ducking control controls between 3 dB attenuation (very little ducking) to – dB (muted).When ducking, the music is also present on the Call only output. If you do not want this, set the ducking control to mute.When ducking, music in a non-selected zone is also affected.table 4.3: Master switch for line out or music onlySlide switch settingEffectTypical exampleLine out All mixed inputs (microphone/line, emergency, and music) are available.Various set-ups are possible.Music onlyA dedicated music out source is available for another external device. Only the music inputs (19, 20, and 21) are available.

These labels can be attached to the mixer amplifier at position numbers 2, 4, and 6 (see figure 2.2). Colored pins can also be inserted at various positions around the dial controls to indicate the favorite settings for a particular application.The pins are engineered in such a way that they cannot be taken out by hand. This is to prevent tampering. The pins are intended to be inserted once, during installation of the unit. The silver pins should be used to indicate the preferred settings of the unit. The red pins can optionally be used to indicate the maximum setting of a knob. If these settings have to be changed, use a pair of soft-tipped pliers to carefully remove the pins. If you do not have a pair of soft-tipped pliers, you can use ordinary pliers instead, but first place some plastic tape on the tips of the pliers to prevent damaging the front of the unit. To remove the clear plastic covers in front of the labels:1Carefully insert a small screwdriver into the cut-out at the bottom of the plastic cover.2Gently lift the cover, and bend it in the middle. Take care not to force the cover or the front panel.To reattach the plastic covers with paper labels:1Insert the paper label into the holder at the front of the unit.2Pick up the cover, and then bend it slightly in the middle by hand. 3Fit the cover into the slot at the front of the unit, and then gently release the cover, making sure that the paper label stays in place.Bosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Connections and settings en | 26Intentionally left blankBosch Security Systems | 2007-10 | PLE-2MA120-EU,  PLE-2MA240-EU enPlena Mixer Amplifier | Installation and User Instructions | Operation en | 275Operation5.1 Switch on and off5.1.1Switch on1Make sure the voltage selector (115V/ 230V) is correctly set for the country’s main voltage (see figure 5.1).2Set the power button (1) on the front of the unit to On - pushed in (see figure 5.2).5.1.2Switch offSet the power button (1) on the front of the unit to Off - popped out (see figure 5.2).CautionPotential equipment damage.

Correspondingly, the tone controls for background music provide the most appropriate music reproduction.The tone controls are not standard bass andtreble controls: they can be used as a traditional tone control with high and low control, but also have a powerful contour that addresses problems found in real situations.5.4.2Microphone/line tone controlThe tone control for the microphone and line inputs boosts warmth in voices without boosting rumble, and cuts rumble without loosing warmth in the low frequencies. In the high frequencies, the tone control boosts sparkle without adding sharpness, but when cutting is first, cuts harshness and sharpness without reducing clarity.Use the Hi (high) and Lo (low) tone controls (see figure 5.2, numbers 3 and 10) to collectively change the tone of microphone/line inputs 1 through 6. 5.4.3Music tone controlThe tone control for the music inputs boosts deep bass first without making the sound boomy, and cuts rumble without loosing warmth in the low frequencies. In the high frequencies, the tone control is similar to the microphone inputs, with slightly different frequencies to suit music reproduction. Use the Hi (high) and Lo (low) tone controls (see figure 5.2, numbers 5 and 13) to change the tone of the selected music source.NoteUsers can create custom labels for the: microphone/line inputs, description of the music sources, and audio output zones 1 and 2. These labels can be attached to the mixer amplifier at position numbers 2, 4, and 6 (see figure 5.2).
