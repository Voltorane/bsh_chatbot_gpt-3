{"text":"title  Suitable detergents, "}
{"text":"  Only use detergents that are suitable for dishwashers. Both separate and combined detergents are suitable., "}
{"text":" For optimum washing and drying results, use separate detergent, adding Special salt and Rinse aid separately., "}
{"text":" Modern, powerful detergents mainly use a low-alkaline formulation with enzymes. Enzymes break down starch and remove protein. Oxygen-based bleaching agents are generally used to remove coloured marks, e.g. tea or ketchup. "}
{"text":" Follow the manufacturer's instructions for each detergent., "}
{"text":" Suitable detergents are available online via our website or from Customer Service . "}
{"text":"title  Separate detergents, "}
{"text":"  Separate detergents are products that do not contain components other than detergent, e.g. powder detergent or liquid detergent., "}
{"text":" With powder and liquid detergent the dosage can be individually adjusted to the level of soiling of the tableware., "}
{"text":" For better washing and drying results and to avoid damage to the appliance, please additionally use Special salt and Rinse aid . "}
{"text":"title  Combined detergent, "}
{"text":"  Besides conventional separate detergents, a number of products are available with additional functions. These products contain not only detergent but also rinse aid and salt replacement substances (3in1) and, depending on the combination (4in1, 5in1, ...), additional components such as glass protection or stainless steel cleaner., "}
{"text":"p  According to manufacturers, combined detergents generally only function up to a water hardness of 26   °E . With a water hardness above 26   °E you will need to add special salt and rinse aid. For the best washing and drying results we recommend using special salt and rinse aid from a water hardness of 17   °E . If you are using combined detergent, the washing programme is adjusted automatically to ensure the best possible washing and drying result., "}
{"text":"title  Unsuitable detergents, "}

{"text":" To open the detergent dispenser, press the locking latch., "}
{"text":" Add the detergent to the dry detergent dispenser. If you are using tablets, one is enough. Insert the tablets in a horizontal position. If you are using powder or liquid detergent, follow the manufacturer's instructions and quantities for dosage in the detergent dispenser. 20 ml – 25 ml detergent is sufficient for normal soiling. If tableware is only lightly soiled, slightly less than the amount of detergent specified is usually sufficient., "}
{"text":" Close the lid of the detergent dispenser. The lid clicks into position. The detergent dispenser will open automatically at the optimum time during the programme. Powder or liquid detergent will spread around the washing tank and dissolve there. Tablets will fall into the tablet collecting tray and dissolve in the right dosage. In order to ensure that tablets can dissolve evenly, do not place any other objects in the tablet collecting tray. "}
{"text":"title  Tableware, "}

{"text":" To save energy and water, load the machine with the number of place settings specified. Technical specifications, "}
{"text":" For better washing and drying results, position items with curves or recesses at an angle so the water can run off. "}
{"text":" Remove large remnants of food from your tableware. To save resources, do not pre-rinse tableware under running water., "}
{"text":" Observe the following when arranging tableware Put heavily soiled tableware in the bottom basket, e.g. pans. The more powerful the spray jet, the better the dishwashing result will be. To prevent damage to tableware, arrange it so it is stable and cannot tip over. To prevent injury, arrange cutlery with the points and sharp edges downwards. Position containers with the openings facing down so no water can collect in them. Do not block the spray arms - make sure that they can turn freely. Do not place small parts in the tablet collecting tray and do not block it with tableware so as not to obstruct the lid of the detergent dispenser. "}

{"text":" For safety reasons repairs to the appliance should only be carried out by trained specialist staff. The warranty claim becomes void if repairs or interventions have been carried out by persons not authorised by us for that purpose or if our appliances have been fitted with spare, supplementary or accessory parts that were not genuine parts and then resulted in a defect., "}

{"text":"title  Saving energy, "}
{"text":"  If you follow these instructions, your appliance will use less electricity and less water., "}
{"text":"title  Zeolith drying, "}
{"text":"  The appliance features a Zeolith container. Zeolith drying lets you save energy., "}
{"text":" Zeolite is a mineral that can store moisture and heat energy and then release them again., "}
{"text":" During dishwashing heat energy is used to heat up the washing water and dry the mineral., "}
{"text":" During the drying phase moisture from the interior of the dishwasher is stored in the mineral and heat energy is released. The heat energy is blown out into the interior of the dishwasher with dry air. This speeds up and improves drying., "}
{"text":" Zeolith drying therefore saves a great deal of energy. "}
{"text":" To avoid impairing Zeolith drying performance, do not position tableware parts directly in front of the intake opening or the blow opening of the Zeolith container., "}
{"text":" Do not position heat-sensitive tableware parts directly in front of the blow opening of the Zeolith container. Appliance, "}

{"text":"title  AquaSensor, "}
{"text":"  The AquaSensor is an optical measuring device (light barrier) which measures the turbidity of the rinsing water. You can save water with the AquaSensor., "}
{"text":"p  Use of the AquaSensor depends on the programme. If the soiling level is high, the rinsing water is drained off and replaced with fresh water. If the soiling level is lower, the rinsing water is used in the next wash cycle, so reducing water consumption by 3-6 litres. In the automatic programmes the temperature and run time are additionally adjusted to the level of soiling., "}
{"text":"title  Sensors, "}
{"text":"  The sensors adjust the programme sequence and strength in the automatic programmes depending on the level and type of soiling., "}
{"text":"p  The sensor has different sensitivity settings that can be changed in the basic settings. Changing basic settings, "}
{"text":"title  Efficient Dry, "}
{"text":"  The appliance door opens automatically during the drying phase. This ensures a particularly economical drying result., "}
{"text":" For best drying results wait until the end of programme before unloading the tableware. The programme has ended when the display shows Finished ., "}
{"text":" If the automatic door opening is deactivated, energy consumption increases and the drying phase is usually reduced., "}
