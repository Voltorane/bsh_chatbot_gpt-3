The amplifier also has  enhanced features such as  ducking level control, prio rity, labelling, and setting  indicators.All Microphone/line inputs  can be switched between  microphone level and line level sensitivity. The inputs are balanced but can also be used unbalanced. Phantom  power can be sele cted via a DIP switch to provide  power to condenser microphones. Input channels 1 and   2 can take priority over al l other microphone and music  inputs:•Input 1 can be activated by  contact closure on a PTT  (push to talk). A chime can be configured to precede  an announcement. •Input 2 can be switched automatically if a signal is  available at the input, for example. if someone   speaks into the microphone (VOX activation). A telephone/100 V eme rgency input with VOX  activation is also provided for easy integration with  another PA system or a tele phone paging system. It has  its own volume control and overrides all other inputs,  including the call stat ion and inputs 1 and 2. The unit also has a line output to add amplifiers for  larger systems that require more output power. This  output can be switched to  music only, for example, so that music on hold can be provided for the telephone   system.

The unit has 24 VDC backup input with built in  24 VDC battery charger. A se parate battery charger is,  therefore, not required. The charger charges the battery  with a 0.5 A constant current until the battery voltage   reaches 27.4 VDC. The charger then switches over to  constant voltage charging (also known as float charging). Note When using the unit with backup power of 24 V,  make sure that the unit is always powered ON.   When the unit is switched OFF, the batteries will  be drained as this will be regarded as a power  source.

This inpu t can be used in mobile  applications, such as boats where 120 or 230 VAC is not  available or in applications that must continue to   operate in case of a power failure. When a 24 VDC battery is connected (typically  consisting of two 12 VDC lead -acid batteries in series),  the unit will operate on the supplied DC voltage. The Plena Mixer Amplifier has as a built in charger,  which charges the connected  battery (or batteries if  connected in series). A se parate battery charger is, therefore, not required. The charger charges the battery  with a 0.5 A constant current  until the battery voltage  reaches 27.4 VDC. The charger then switches over to  constant voltage charging (als o known as float charging).  This means that a battery can be charged at the same   rate it is discharging, and th us full capacity battery can  be assured. This type of charging is suited for low duty-cycle  applications where a relatively high current or power is  infrequently required.   Caution The connection cable must have an in-line fuse.   Use the type of fuse shown in the following   figure. Caution Make sure the unit is earthed. Note If the backup power system has to comply to the  "}

The PTT  mode can be activated by setting the DIP switch (4) at   the rear of the unit. Microphone/line 1 input has  priority over all other  microphone/line inputs.If, however, the “Tel. emerge ncy/100V input” receives a  signal, all inputs including  microphone/line 1 input will  be overruled.The microphone/line 1 input has two connectors wired  in parallel:   •an XLR connector (for a 3 pole microphone), and •a Euro style pluggable  screw terminal connector.

See figure 4.5. Microphone/line input 2 has a  DIP switch (4) at the rear  of the unit for setting the VOX mode. If the DIP switch   is set to VOX, the microphone/line input will  automatically be switched when a signal is sensed at the  microphone/line 2 input. For example, when someone   speaks into the microphone, other sound will either be  muted or ducked, depending on the setting of the  ducking level control at the rear of the unit.
